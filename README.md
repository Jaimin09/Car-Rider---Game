# Cars-Game
A fun multi-level cars game, where the objective of the player car is to reach the destination without any hit from the traffic or boundaries.

Playing this game refreshes our childhood memory, where we must have had played the similar game in our gaming console.

This game made using pygame library of python has :
- Two difficulty level
- Sound, buttons and graphics
- In 1st level, the traffic moves at a steady speed in front direction. But in 2nd level some of the traffic cars in black can also move side-ways and thus increasint difficulty.
- The traffic is generated randomly everytime we start the game.
- And most importantly, it challenges us everytime we play it.

- 'Images' Folder : contains all the required images for the game which helps creating the graphics
- 'Sounds' Folder : contains all the sound clips required for the game to make it more interesting
- main.py : is the main file, through which the game can be played.
